Setup a project locally and create your own git repository called prototype-basics with the following requirements:

Project must be setup to be testable with Mocha/Chai to have unit tests written
Two JavaScript files will be written that must both be testable: array_extensions.js & string_extensions.js
You must set up your index.html file to load all needed files and run your tests
Generate a README.md to document what your project does and how to use it. Ok to use the contents of this file and edit appropriately.




1 . Write a series of functions on the Array.prototype that implement the following functionality.

toString - This method must take the contents of the Array and return a string of the contents of that array but should check for functions and null and exclude them from the returned value.

forEach - This method must take a function as an argument and call that function against each element in the Array.

EXTRA - Take your array functions that you wrote in ArrayFun and add them to the Array.prototype.







2 . Write a series of functions on the String.prototype that implement the following functionality.

wtf - This method must return the value 'wtf' for any given context.

scramble - This method must return the contents of the string in the current context in a mixed up order.

trim - This method must return the contents of the string with no leading or trailing spaces.







3 . Write a series of functions on the 'Number.prototype' that implement the following functionality.

double - This method must return the current Number in context but doubled.

tripledouble - This method must return the current Number in context but tripled and then doubled.

isDivisibleBy - This method must take a number as input and return true/false if the current Number in context is evenly divisible by our parameter number.

submultitractivide - This method must take a number as input and perform 2 random Math operations to that number between: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.






4 . EXPLORE!! WRITE 3 OF YOUR OWN PROTOTYPE FUNCTIONS THAT ARE TESTABLE AND FUNCTIONAL. ALSO, CHALLENGE YOURSELF. DON'T DO SOMETHING TO JUST GET IT DONE.
